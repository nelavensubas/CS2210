# Computer Science 2210 - Data Structures and Algorithms - The University of Western Ontario
## Course Description
The purpose of this course is to provide the students with solid foundations in the basic concepts of programming: data structures and algorithms. The main objective of the course is to teach the students how to select and design data structures and algorithms that are appropriate for problems that they might encounter. This course is also about showing the correctness of algorithms and studying their computational complexities. This course offers the students a mixture of theoretical knowledge and practical experience.

The study of data structures and algorithms is carried out within an object-oriented framework. When implementations are considered, the Java programming language is used. Topics covered in this course include:
- analysis of algorithms
- dictionaries, hash tables
- trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, multi-way search trees, (2,4)-trees, B-trees
- graphs, graph traversals, graph algorithms
- sorting
## Assignments
- Assignment 2 - Tic-Tac-Toe: A Java program that plays *(n, k)*-tic-tac-toe; *(n, k)*-tic-tac-toe is played on a board of size *n Ã— n* and to win the game a player needs to put *k* symbols on adjacent positions of the same row, column, or diagonal.
- Assignment 4 - Representing Figures with Binary Search Trees: A Java program that manipulates graphical figures where a graphical figure is just a set of pixels forming an image. We are interested in displaying the figures and moving them around, detecting collisions when they occur.
- Assignment 5 - Road Map: A Java program that finds a path between two specified points in a road map, if such a path exists.
